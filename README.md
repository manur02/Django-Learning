# advcbv: Django Learning Project

This repository contains one of my **Django learning projects**, focused on exploring and understanding **Class-Based Views (CBVs)**. The project, named **advcbv** (short for **Advanced Class-Based Views**), is a hands-on exercise in implementing and experimenting with CBVs such as **ListView**, **DetailView**, **TemplateView**, and CRUD operations.

This project is purely for **learning and exploration purposes**, aimed at enhancing my skills and deepening my understanding of Django's CBV architecture. It serves as a stepping stone in my journey of mastering advanced Django features.
